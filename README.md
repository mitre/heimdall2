## Heimdall (Lite) vs Heimdall with Backend (Server)

There are two ways to deploy the MITRE Heimdall application - Heimdall-Lite and the full Heimdall with Backend Server. Both share the same frontend but have been produced to meet different needs and use-cases.

### Heimdall-Lite

As a single-page javascript app - you can run Heimdall-Lite from any web-server, a _secured_ S3 bucket or directly via GitHub Pages (as it is here). Heimdall-Lite gives you the ability to easily review and produce reports about your InSpec run, filter the results for easy review and hot-wash, print out reports, and much more.

### Heimdall with Backend (Server)

Heimdall with Backend, or Heimdall Server runs the same front end as Heimdall-Lite, but is supported with a backend database to store persistent data overtime.

## Getting Started / Installation

### Heimdall Lite

Heimdall Lite is published to npmjs.org and is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heimdall-lite).

#### Running via npm

To run Heimdall Lite locally, just use the `npm` built-in utility `npx`:

```bash
npx @mitre/heimdall-lite
```

If you use this tool often and want to have it installed locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @mitre/heimdall-lite
```

Then, any subsequent `npx @mitre/heimdall-lite` will use the local version and load much more quickly.

#### Running via Docker

It is also possible to run Heimdall-Lite using Docker, using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 mitre/heimdall-lite:release-latest
```

You can then access Heimdall-Lite at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080).

If you would prefer to run the bleeding edge version of Heimdall-Lite, replace `mitre/heimdall-lite:release-latest` with `mitre/heimdall-lite:latest`.

---

### Heimdall Server - Docker

Given that Heimdall requires at least a database service, we use Docker and Docker Compose to provide a simple deployment experience. This process will also deploy an NGINX webserver in front of Heimdall to handle TLS.

Heimdall's frontend container image is distributed on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mitre/heimdall2), and on [Iron Bank](https://ironbank.dso.mil/repomap/details;registry1Path=mitre%252Fsaf%252Fheimdall2).

#### Setup Docker Container (Clean Install)

1. Install Docker

2. Download and extract the most recent Heimdall release from our [releases page](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/releases). Alternatively, you can clone this repository and navigate to the `heimdall2` folder.

3. Navigate to the base folder where `docker-compose.yml` is located

4. By default Heimdall will generate self-signed certificates that will last for 7 days. For production use, place your certificate files in `./nginx/certs/` with the names `ssl_certificate.crt` and `ssl_certificate_key.key` respectively. For development use, you can use the default generated certificates which means you do not need to put any certificate files in the `./nginx/certs/` folder.

  *NGINX Configuration Note: You can configure NGINX settings by changing values in the `nginx/conf/default.conf` file.*

5. Run the following commands in a terminal window from the Heimdall source directory. For more information on the .env file, visit [Environment Variables Configuration.](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/Environment-Variables-Configuration)
   ```bash
   # For Linux or Mac
   ./setup-docker-env.sh
   
   # For Windows
   ./setup-docker-env.bat
   ```

> [!TIP]
> If you would like to further configure your Docker-based Heimdall deployment, edit the .env file located in the root directory generated after running the `setup-docker-env.sh` or `setup-docker-env.bat` scripts

6. Heimdall might need certificates to access the open internet or internal resources (ex. an LDAP server).  Please convert any certificates into PEM files and place them in `./certs/` where they will be automatically ingested.  Alternatively, you can place a shell script that will retrieve those certs in that directory, and modify the `command` attribute underneath the `certs` service in the `docker-compose.yml` to run that script.
  ```bash
  # Below is an example of what may be in the ./certs directory, including any scripts or certificates.
  # ./certs/
  # ├── dodcerts.sh
  # └── my_certificates.pem

  # For the given example, the ./docker-compose.yml should look like the following:
  services:
    ...
    certs:
      ...
      command: sh -c "sh /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/dodcerts.sh && update-ca-trust && tail -f /dev/null"
      # NOTE: The `command` attribute only needs to know about scripts not any particular certificates.
      ...
    ...
  ```
  To make the `docker-compose.yml` aware of additional scripts, add `sh /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/NAME_OF_SCRIPT.sh && ` to the beginning of the section in quotes.
  NOTE: The script should make sure to place the certs within `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` since it will be run from the container, not the host.

7. Start Heimdall Server by running this command:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

8. Navigate to [`https://127.0.0.1`](http://127.0.0.1). You should see the application's login page. (Note that if you used the option to generate your own self-signed certs, you will get warnings about them from your browser.)

#### Updating Docker Container

> **Starting with version 2.5.0, Heimdall on Docker uses SSL by default. Place your certificate files in `./nginx/certs/` with the names `ssl_certificate.crt` and `ssl_certificate_key.key` respectively.**

A new version of the docker container can be retrieved by running:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

This will fetch the latest version of the container, redeploy if a newer version exists, and then apply any database migrations if applicable. No data should be lost by this operation.

#### Stopping the Container

From the source directory you started from run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### Running via Cloud.gov

Cloud.gov is a [FEDRAMP moderate Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/product/18f-cloudgov?sort=productName). This repository includes a sample [manifest.yml.example](manifest.yml.example) file ready to be pushed and run the latest version of Heimdall2 as a container. Make a copy of the example file and update the key values as appropriate.
`$ cp manifest.yml.example manifest.yml`

1. Setup a cloud.gov account - https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/accounts/ 

2. Install the cf-cli - https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/

3. Run the following commands in a terminal window from the Heimdall source directory.
```
$ cd ~/Documents/Github/Heimdall2
$ cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov  --sso 
# Follow the link to copy the Temporary Authentication Code when prompted
```

4. Setup a demo application space
```
$ cf target -o sandbox-rename create-space heimdall2-rename
```

5. Create a PostgreSQL database
```
# Update manifest.yml file to rename application and database key name
$ cf marketplace
$ cf create-service aws-rds medium-psql heimdall2-rename
$ cf create-service-key heimdall2-db-rename heimdall2-db-test-key
$ cf push
```

**You should be returned the URL for your new test instance to navigate to.**

> Note: This is only for demonstration purposes, in order to run a production level federal/FISMA system. You will need to contact the [cloud.gov program](https://cloud.gov) and consult your organization's security team (for risk assessment and an Authority to Operate).

## External Data Sources (Interfaces)

Heimdall currently provides connectivity to the following services for importing and visualizing scans:
  - AWS S3
  - Splunk
  - Tenable.SC

### AWS S3

For detail information on how to setup and connect to an `AWS S3` bucket see the [Heimdall Interface Connection - AWS S3 Wiki](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/Heimdall-Interface-Connections#aws-s3)

### Splunk

For detail information on how to setup and connect to an `Splunk` instances (logical or virtual) see the [Heimdall Interface Connection - Splunk Wiki](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/Heimdall-Interface-Connections#splunk)

### Tenable.SC

For detail information on how to setup and connect to an `Tenable.SC` instance see the [Heimdall Interface Connection - Tenable.SC Wiki](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/Heimdall-Interface-Connections#tenablesc)


## API Usage

API usage only works when using Heimdall Enterprise Server (AKA "Server Mode").

Heimdall API documentation is being compiled and it is located in this  [wiki](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/Heimdall-API-Documentation) page. In the meantime here are quick instructions for uploading evaluations to Heimdall Server.

```sh
# To use API Keys, ensure you have set the API_KEY_SECRET environment variable. To create a secret run: openssl rand -hex 33
# Create an API key using the Heimdall frontend (within the edit user profile modal) and upload an evaluation with the following command
curl -F "data=@<Path to Evaluation File>" -F "filename=<Filename To Show in Heimdall>" -F "public=true/false" -F "evaluationTags=<tag-name>,<another-tag-name>..." -H "Authorization: Api-Key apikeygoeshere" "http://localhost:3000/evaluations"
# You can upload multiple files at once (up to 100)
curl -F "data=@<Path to first evaluation File>" -F "data=@<Path to second evaluation File>" ... -F "public=true/false" -F "evaluationTags=<tag-name>,<another-tag-name>..." -H "Authorization: Api-Key apikeygoeshere" "http://localhost:3000/evaluations"
```

## For Developers

### How to Install

If you would like to change Heimdall to your needs, you can use Heimdall's 'Development Mode' to ease the development process. The benefit to using this mode is that it will automatically rebuild itself and use those changes as soon as you make them. Please note that you should not run development mode when deploying Heimdall for general usage.

1. Install system dependencies with your system's package manager. NodeJS is required and can be installed via your system's package manager, or an alternative method if desired. Documented below is the installation via your system's package manager.

   Ubuntu:

   - ```bash
     # grab nodesource for recent version of nodejs
     sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x -o /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh
     sudo bash /tmp/nodesource_setup.sh

     # use apt to install dependencies
     sudo apt install postgresql nodejs git
     sudo apt install nano                        # recommended installation
     sudo npm install -g yarn
     ```

   **NOTES** 

     - The installation scripts setup_XX.x are no longer supported and are not needed anymore, as the installation process is straightforward for any RPM and DEB distro.
    
     - See the [Debian and Ubuntu based distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions) nodesource for nodejs supported version and additional installation information
  
   OSX:
   
   - ```bash
     brew install postgresql node@18 git      
     brew install nano                        # recommended installation
     sudo npm install -g yarn
     ```

   WINDOWS:

     yarn install      # you may need to run yarn install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
     ```

5. Edit your apps/backend/.env file using the provided `setup-dev-env.sh or setup-dev-env.bat` script. Make sure to set a DATABASE_USERNAME and DATABASE_PASSWORD that match what you set for the PostgresDB in step 3.

You can also open the apps/backend/.env file in a text editor and set additional optional configuration values. For more info on configuration values see [Environment Variables Configuration](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/Environment-Variables-Configuration).

> [!NOTE]
> The .env file in the root repository is for the Docker deployment of the Heimdall application. Running a local build will use the .env file in the `apps/backend` directory.

6. Create the database:

   - ```bash
     # Windows
     yarn backend sequelize-cli-windows db:create
     yarn backend sequelize-cli-windows db:migrate
     yarn backend sequelize-cli-windows db:seed:all

     # All other OSs
     yarn backend sequelize-cli db:create
     yarn backend sequelize-cli db:migrate
     yarn backend sequelize-cli db:seed:all
     ```

6. Start Heimdall:

   - ```bash
     yarn start:dev
     ```

This will start both the frontend and backend in development mode, meaning any changes you make to the source code will take effect immediately. Please note we already have a Visual Studio Code workspace file you can use to organize your workspace.

### Debugging Heimdall Server

If you are using Visual Studio Code, it is very simple to debug this application locally. First open up the Visual Studio Code workspace and ensure the [Node debugger Auto Attach](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_auto-attach) feature in Visual Studio Code is enabled. Next, open the integrated Visual Studio Code terminal and run:

```
yarn backend start:debug
```

Visual Studio Code will then automatically attach a debugger and stop and any breakpoints you place in the application.

### Developing Heimdall Lite Standalone

If you only want to make changes to the frontend (heimdall-lite) use the following command:

    yarn frontend start:dev

### Lint and fix files

To validate and lint your code run:

    yarn run lint

### Compile and minify the frontend and backend for production

    yarn build

### Run tests

To test your code to make sure everything still works:

    # Run Frontend Vue Tests
    yarn frontend test
    # Run Backend Nest Tests (see note)
    yarn backend test:ci-cov

<span style="color:red">**NOTE:**</span> The `Backend Nest Tests` will remove (BULKDELETE) all entries in the configured PostgreSQL server for the following tables:
 - EvaluationTags
 - Evaluations
 - Users
 - GroupEvaluations
 - Groups
 - GroupUsers


#### Run Cypress End to End Tests

The application includes an End-to-End (E2E) frontend and Backend tests (built using the [cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) framework). The E2E tests performed is to validate  that Heimdall Server is running as intended. In order to run these tests, a running instance of the application is required.

    CYPRESS_TESTING=true yarn start:dev
    CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 yarn test:ui:open

The first command will start an instance of Heimdall Server and exposes additional routes required to allow the tests to run. The second will open the Cypress UI which will run the tests any time code changes are made.

> [!NOTE] 
> When running the tests locally, tests that integrate with external services such as LDAP or Splunk will fail without having that external service running and configured. If these failures occur locally and local development does not impact the code relevant to those tests, you may consider permitting these failing tests locally and check that they pass in the pipeline in lieu of standing up local services only for testing purposes.

### Creating a Release

**Note:** This action requires appropriate privileges on the repository to perform.

The steps to create a release are now on the [wiki](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2/wiki/How-to-create-a-Heimdall2-release).
