## BRANCH INFORMATION

- **Branch Name**: `okta-openid-client-hybrid`
- **Created From**: `master`
- **Purpose**: Implement a hybrid approach using openid-client for Okta authentication while maintaining other Passport strategies

## KEY CHANGES MADE

1. **Replaced the Okta Strategy**
   - Switched from passport-openidconnect to openid-client
   - Added automatic discovery of OpenID Connect endpoints
   - Implemented PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for better security
   - Enhanced validation and error handling

2. **Improved Authentication Exception Filter**
   - Added correlation IDs for tracking authentication errors
   - Implemented cookie clearing to prevent cascading errors
   - Enhanced error reporting with more user-friendly messages
   - Added structured logging for better debugging

3. **Enhanced Session Management**
   - Fixed session middleware configuration
   - Improved cookie settings (httpOnly, SameSite, etc.)
   - Added proper serialization/deserialization
   - Implemented session debugging in development mode

4. **Updated Authentication Controller**
   - Added proper exception filters for each auth type
   - Enhanced cookie settings for user session cookies 
   - Improved logging throughout authentication flow

## FILES MODIFIED

1. `/apps/backend/package.json` - Added openid-client dependency
2. `/apps/backend/src/authn/okta.strategy.ts` - Complete rewrite using openid-client
3. `/apps/backend/src/filters/authentication-exception.filter.ts` - Enhanced error handling and logging
4. `/apps/backend/src/main.ts` - Improved session and passport configuration
5. `/apps/backend/src/authn/authn.controller.ts` - Updated auth controller with better logging and error handling

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Testing**
   - Test the implementation with an actual Okta provider
   - Verify that first-time authentication works properly
   - Test error handling scenarios (invalid credentials, network issues, etc.)
   - Verify session persistence across page refreshes

2. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for this authentication approach
   - Update environment variable documentation to include new Okta settings
   - Document troubleshooting steps for common authentication issues

3. **Performance and Security Considerations**
   - Review cookie settings for optimal security
   - Consider adding rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Evaluate session storage options for better performance

4. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Consider extending openid-client approach to OIDC strategy as well
   - Add support for Okta groups and roles
   - Implement refresh token handling for longer sessions

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The core issue being addressed is that the original implementation using passport-openidconnect was failing during the first authentication attempt, likely due to issues with OpenID Connect state parameter handling and session management.

The key insight of our solution is to use the more robust openid-client library specifically for Okta authentication, while maintaining compatibility with other authentication methods that use Passport.

Key technical components:

1. **Endpoint Discovery**: We use the Issuer.discover() method to automatically find the correct endpoints for the Okta identity provider.

2. **State Parameter Handling**: The openid-client library has better handling of the state parameter, which helps prevent the "Unable to verify authorization request state" errors.

3. **PKCE Implementation**: We added PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security.

4. **Session Configuration**: We improved the session middleware configuration with better cookie settings and explicit passport serialization.

5. **Error Recovery**: We implemented cookie clearing on authentication failures to ensure a clean start for subsequent attempts.

By combining these approaches, we've created a robust hybrid solution that should address the authentication issues without requiring a complete rewrite of the authentication system.

## RECOVERY PROMPT

You are working on enhancing the Okta authentication in the Heimdall2 application. The main issue was that the first authentication attempt would fail with state verification errors, but subsequent attempts would succeed.

You've implemented a hybrid approach that:
- Uses openid-client for Okta while keeping passport for other strategies
- Improves session handling and cookie management
- Enhances error handling with correlation IDs
- Adds better logging throughout the authentication flow

The next step is to:
- Create comprehensive documentation for this approach
- Test the implementation with a real Okta provider
- Consider extending this approach to the OIDC strategy as well

The key files you've modified are:
- okta.strategy.ts - Rewrote using openid-client
- authentication-exception.filter.ts - Enhanced error handling
- main.ts - Improved session configuration
- authn.controller.ts - Updated with better logging
