# OHDF Converters

"[OASIS Heimdall Data Format (OHDF)](https://saf.mitre.org/#/normalize)" is our common data exchange format to preserve and transform security data.

OHDF Converters supplies several methods to convert various types of security tool data to and from the OHDF standard. OHDF Converters can be used in a variety of tools, and is currently well integrated with Heimdall itself, and the [SAF CLI](https://github.com/mitre/saf).
