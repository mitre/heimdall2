After you turn on mailbox audit logging for a mailbox, you can search the audit log for mailbox activity.

When mailbox auditing on by default is turned on for the organization, the AuditEnabled property for affected mailboxes won't be changed from False to True. In other words, mailbox auditing on by default ignores the AuditEnabled property on mailboxes.</p> <p>However, only certain mailbox types support default auditing setting 'On': User Mailboxes, Shared Mailboxes, and Microsoft 365 Group Mailboxes. The remaining mailbox types require auditing to be turned on at the mailbox level: Resource Mailboxes, Public Folder Mailboxes, and DiscoverySearch Mailbox.</p> <p>Whether it is for regulatory compliance or for tracking unauthorized configuration changes in Microsoft 365, enabling mailbox auditing allows for Microsoft 365 back office teams to run security operations, forensics or general investigations on mailbox activities.</p> <p>NOTE: Without advanced auditing (E5 function) the logs are limited to 90 days.</p>",
