Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by following the steps below:   The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed.

Per OPORD 16-0080, the preferred intrusion detection system is McAfee HBSS available through the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).   If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.   Procedure:  Examine the system to determine if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed:   # rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm   Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system:   # ps -ef | grep -i “hipclient”   If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion detection system:   # find / -name <daemon name>   Where <daemon name> is the name of the primary application daemon to determine if the application is loaded on the system.   Determine if the application is active on the system:   # ps -ef | grep -i <daemon name>   If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.   If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the system, this is a finding."

Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues."

Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by following the steps below:   The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed.
