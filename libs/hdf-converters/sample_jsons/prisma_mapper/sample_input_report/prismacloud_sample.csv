If cgo is specified in a Go file, it is possible to bypass the validation of arguments to the gcc compiler. This flaw allows an attacker to create a malicious repository that can execute arbitrary code when downloaded and run via `go get` or `go build` while building a Go project. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.             STATEMENT: While the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger (RHOSJ),  OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM), and OpenShift Virtualization all contain RPMs and containers that are compiled with a vulnerable version of Go, the vulnerability is specific to the building of the Go code itself. Using `go get` or `go build` and as such, the relevant components have been marked as not affected.  Additionally, only the main RPMs and containers for OCP, RHOSJ, OSSM, and OpenShift Virtualization are represented due to the large volume of not affected components.  Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 ships the vulnerable version of go, and an attacker building go code on RHCS 3 could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

Applications written in Go where Reader.Open (the API implementing io/fs.FS introduced in Go 1.16) can panic when parsing a crafted ZIP archive containing completely invalid names or an empty filename argument.             STATEMENT: * In OpenShift Container Platform multiple components are written in Go and use archive/zip from the standard library. However, all such components are short lived client side tools, not long lived server side executables. As the maximum impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service in client utilities, this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Plaform.  * Because Service Telemetry Framework1.2 will be retiring soon and the flaw\'s impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for STF1.2\'s sg-core-container.  * Because Red Hat Ceph Storage only uses Go\'s archive/zip for the Grafana CLI and thus is not directly exploitable, the vulnerability has been rated low for Red Hat Ceph Storage.",,2021-08-30 00:00:00.000,,,http://somewhere.cloud/detail/CVE-2021-41772
