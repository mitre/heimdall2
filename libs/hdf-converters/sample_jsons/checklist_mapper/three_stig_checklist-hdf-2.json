The JSM works the same way a client's web browser isolates a running web application via a sandbox, the difference being the sandbox is running on the server rather than the client. To ensure application operability, JSM security policies must be set to allow the hosted application access to the underlying system based on individual application requirements. The JSM settings cannot be determined at the STIG level and will vary based on each hosted application.\\n\\nExamples include setting JSM policy to allow an application to write to folders on the server or to initiate network connections to other servers via TCP/IP.\\n\\nBecause the JSM isolates application code to prevent an application from adversely accessing resources on the underlying Tomcat server, care must be taken to ensure the JSM policies are configured properly. Allowing untrusted web applications to run on the Tomcat server without a JSM policy that limits access to server resources creates a risk of compromise to the server. \\n\\nIdeally, the JSM policy is implemented and tested during the application development phase. This is when the application resource requirements are best identified and documented so the correct JSM policy can be implemented in the production environment.  \\n\\nCreating the correct JSM policy can be a challenge when installing commercial software that does not provide the policy as part of the installation process or via documentation. This is due to the fact that the critical application access requirements to the system will typically not be known to the system administrator. In these cases, running the JSM can result in failure for some application functionality (e.g., an application might not be able to write logs to a particular folder on the system or communicate with other systems as intended). \\n\\nWhen faced with application functionality failures, the typical troubleshooting approach for the system administrator to follow is to install the application in a test environment, set the $CATALINA_POLICY setting to debug, and identify failure events in the logs. This can aid in identifying what privileges the application requires. From there the JSM policies can be set, tested, documented, and transferred to production. If these actions do not address all of the issues, the Risk Management Framework processes come into effect and a risk acceptance for this requirement must be obtained from the ISSO.\\n\\nFor additional technical information on the security manager and available JSM policy settings, refer to the Security Manager How-To on the Apache Tomcat version 9 website.\",\n  \"iaControls\": \"\",\n  \"checkContent\": \"Review system documentation.

              "vulnDiscuss": "The Java Security Manager (JSM) is what protects the Tomcat server from trojan servlets, JSPs, JSP beans, tag libraries, or even from inadvertent mistakes. The JSM works the same way a client's web browser isolates a running web application via a sandbox, the difference being the sandbox is running on the server rather than the client. To ensure application operability, JSM security policies must be set to allow the hosted application access to the underlying system based on individual application requirements. The JSM settings cannot be determined at the STIG level and will vary based on each hosted application.\n\nExamples include setting JSM policy to allow an application to write to folders on the server or to initiate network connections to other servers via TCP/IP.\n\nBecause the JSM isolates application code to prevent an application from adversely accessing resources on the underlying Tomcat server, care must be taken to ensure the JSM policies are configured properly. Allowing untrusted web applications to run on the Tomcat server without a JSM policy that limits access to server resources creates a risk of compromise to the server. \n\nIdeally, the JSM policy is implemented and tested during the application development phase. This is when the application resource requirements are best identified and documented so the correct JSM policy can be implemented in the production environment.  \n\nCreating the correct JSM policy can be a challenge when installing commercial software that does not provide the policy as part of the installation process or via documentation. This is due to the fact that the critical application access requirements to the system will typically not be known to the system administrator. In these cases, running the JSM can result in failure for some application functionality (e.g., an application might not be able to write logs to a particular folder on the system or communicate with other systems as intended). \n\nWhen faced with application functionality failures, the typical troubleshooting approach for the system administrator to follow is to install the application in a test environment, set the $CATALINA_POLICY setting to debug, and identify failure events in the logs. This can aid in identifying what privileges the application requires. From there the JSM policies can be set, tested, documented, and transferred to production. If these actions do not address all of the issues, the Risk Management Framework processes come into effect and a risk acceptance for this requirement must be obtained from the ISSO.\n\nFor additional technical information on the security manager and available JSM policy settings, refer to the Security Manager How-To on the Apache Tomcat version 9 website.",

The JSM works the same way a client's web browser isolates a running web application via a sandbox, the difference being the sandbox is running on the server rather than the client. To ensure application operability, JSM security policies must be set to allow the hosted application access to the underlying system based on individual application requirements. The JSM settings cannot be determined at the STIG level and will vary based on each hosted application.\n\nExamples include setting JSM policy to allow an application to write to folders on the server or to initiate network connections to other servers via TCP/IP.\n\nBecause the JSM isolates application code to prevent an application from adversely accessing resources on the underlying Tomcat server, care must be taken to ensure the JSM policies are configured properly. Allowing untrusted web applications to run on the Tomcat server without a JSM policy that limits access to server resources creates a risk of compromise to the server. \n\nIdeally, the JSM policy is implemented and tested during the application development phase. This is when the application resource requirements are best identified and documented so the correct JSM policy can be implemented in the production environment.  \n\nCreating the correct JSM policy can be a challenge when installing commercial software that does not provide the policy as part of the installation process or via documentation. This is due to the fact that the critical application access requirements to the system will typically not be known to the system administrator. In these cases, running the JSM can result in failure for some application functionality (e.g., an application might not be able to write logs to a particular folder on the system or communicate with other systems as intended). \n\nWhen faced with application functionality failures, the typical troubleshooting approach for the system administrator to follow is to install the application in a test environment, set the $CATALINA_POLICY setting to debug, and identify failure events in the logs. This can aid in identifying what privileges the application requires. From there the JSM policies can be set, tested, documented, and transferred to production. If these actions do not address all of the issues, the Risk Management Framework processes come into effect and a risk acceptance for this requirement must be obtained from the ISSO.\n\nFor additional technical information on the security manager and available JSM policy settings, refer to the Security Manager How-To on the Apache Tomcat version 9 website."

While root has read/write privileges, group only has read permissions, and world has no permissions. The exceptions are the logs, temp, and work directories that are owned by the Tomcat user rather than root. This means that even if an attacker compromises the Tomcat process, they cannot change the Tomcat configuration, deploy new web applications, or modify existing web applications. The Tomcat process runs with a umask of 0027 to maintain these permissions. Note that running Tomcat in a Docker environment can impact how file permissions and user ownership settings are applied.

Tomcat does provide an HTTP server that can be configured to make hosted applications available to clients directly. However, this HTTP server has performance limitations and is not intended to be used on an enterprise scale. Exposing this service to untrusted networks also violates the layered security model and creates elevated risk of attack. To address these issues, a proxy or load balancer can be placed in front of the Tomcat server. To ensure the proxied connection is not spoofed, SSL mutual authentication must be employed between Tomcat and the proxy.\n\nNot all Tomcat systems will have an RMF system categorization that warrants mutual authentication protections. The site must determine if mutual authentication is warranted based on their system RMF categorization and data protection requirements. If the site determines that MA is not a requirement, they can document a risk acceptance for not mutually authenticating proxy or load balancer connections due to operational issues, or when the RMF system categorization does not warrant the added level of protection."

The standard configuration is to have Tomcat files contained in the conf/ folder as members of the \"tomcat\" group. While root has read/write privileges, group only has read permissions, and world has no permissions. The exceptions are the logs, temp, and work directories that are owned by the Tomcat user rather than root. This means that even if an attacker compromises the Tomcat process, they cannot change the Tomcat configuration, deploy new web applications, or modify existing web applications. The Tomcat process runs with a umask of 0027 to maintain these permissions. Note that running Tomcat in a Docker environment can impact how file permissions and user ownership settings are applied. Due to associated Docker configuration complexities, the STIG is scoped for standalone rather than virtual Docker deployments.\n\nIf the ISSM determines the operational need to allow application admins access to change the Tomcat configuration outweighs the risk of limiting that access, then they can change the group membership to accommodate.  Ownership must not be changed.  The ISSM should take the exposure of the system to high risk networks into account."
