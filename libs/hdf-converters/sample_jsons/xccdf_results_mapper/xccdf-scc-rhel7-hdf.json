The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.\n\nInstall the dracut-fips package with the following command:\n\n# yum install dracut-fips\n\nRecreate the \"initramfs\" file with the following command:\n\nNote: This command will overwrite the existing \"initramfs\" file.\n\n# dracut -f\n\nModify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the \"grub.cfg\" file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the \"/etc/default/grub\" file and then rebuild the \"grub.cfg\" file:\n\nfips=1\n\nChanges to \"/etc/default/grub\" require rebuilding the \"grub.cfg\" file as follows:\n\nOn BIOS-based machines, use the following command:\n\n# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n\nOn UEFI-based machines, use the following command:\n\n# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg\n\nIf /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter boot=<partition of /boot or /boot/efi> must be added to the kernel command line. You can identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi command:\n\n# df /boot\nFilesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot\n\nTo ensure the \"boot=\" configuration option will work even if device naming changes occur between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the partition with the following command:\n\n# blkid /dev/sda1\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nFor the example above, append the following string to the kernel command line:\n\nboot=UUID=05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797\n\nIf the file /etc/system-fips does not exists, recreate it:\n\n# touch /etc/ system-fips\n\nReboot the system for the changes to take effect.",
