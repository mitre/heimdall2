Note that it is not sufficient to limit\n  sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate\n  users and adversaries can potentially connect to PostgreSQL by other means.\n  The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions\n  by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the\n  appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the\n  various types of users.

To mitigate the risk of\n        unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been\n        issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including\n        databases, must be properly configured to implement access control\n        policies.\n\n        Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access\n        to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls\n        must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a\n        validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of\n        determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to\n        access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies\n        and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\n        Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based\n        policies, and attribute-based policies.
