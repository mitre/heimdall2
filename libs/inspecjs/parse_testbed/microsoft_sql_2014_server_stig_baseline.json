All features of SQL Server Audit\n  are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It\n  is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy\n  reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains\n  an acceptable solution for the time being.

Right-click on the file, click Properties.\n  On the Security tab, modify the security permissions to:\n  Administrator(read)\n  Users (none)\n  Audit Administrator(Full Control)\n  Auditors group (Read)\n  SQL Server Service SID OR Service Account (Full Control) [Notes 1, 2]\n  SQL Server SQL Agent Service SID OR Service Account, if SQL Server Agent is in\n  use. (Read, Execute, Write) [Notes 1, 2]\n\n  -----\n\n  Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When\n  installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these\n  provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as\n  virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the\n  same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with\n  the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather\n  than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control,\n  because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is\n  running, and not in any other context. (However, when using failover\n  clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a\n  virtual account.) For more on this topic, see\n  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.120).aspx.\n\n  Note 2: Tips for adding a service SID/virtual account to a folder's permission\n  list.\n  1) In Windows Explorer, right-click on the folder and select \\\"Properties.\\\"\n  2) Select the \\\"Security\\\" tab\n  3) Click \\\"Edit\\\"\n  4) Click \\\"Add\\\"\n  5) Click \\\"Locations\\\"\n  6) Select the computer name\n  7) Search for the name\n  7.a) SQL Server Service\n  7.a.i) Type \\\"NT SERVICE\\\\MSSQL\\\" and click \\\"Check Names\\\". (What you have\n  just typed in is the first 16 characters of the name. At least one character\n  must follow \\\"NT SERVICE\\\\\\\"; you will be presented with a list of all matches.\n  If you have typed in the full, correct name, step 7.a.ii is bypassed.)\n  7.a.ii) Select the \\\"MSSQL$<instance name>\\\" user and click OK\n  7.b) SQL Agent Service\n  7.b.i) Type \\\"NT SERVICE\\\\SQL\\\" and click \\\"Check Names\\\"\n  7.b.ii) Select the \\\"SQLAgent$<instance

Therefore, it must be possible\n  to configure auditing to do this. DBMSs typically make such information\n  available through views or functions.\n\n      This requirement addresses explicit requests for privilege/permission/role\n  membership information. It does not refer to the implicit retrieval of\n  privileges/permissions/role memberships that the DBMS continually performs to\n  determine if any and every action on the database is permitted.\n\n      To aid in diagnosis, it is necessary to keep track of failed attempts in\n  addition to the successful ones.\n\n      Use of SQL Server Audit is recommended.  All features of SQL Server Audit\n  are available in the Enterprise and Developer editions of SQL Server 2014.  It\n  is not available at the database level in other editions.  For this or legacy\n  reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains\n  an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft\n  intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.\n\n      This requirement applies to SQL Server Audit-based audit trails; Trace does\n  not have this capability.\n\n      Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all\n  accesses, successful and otherwise, to the system views (and all other\n  schema-scoped objects).  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates\n  the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may\n  report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For\n  example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as\n  successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it\n  contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider\n  failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at\n  all.\n  \"\n  impact 0.7\n  tag \"gtitle\": 'SRG-APP-000091-DB-000325'\n  tag \"gid\": 'V-67771'\n  tag \"rid\": 'SV-82261r2_rule'\n  tag \"stig_id\": 'SQL4-00-030410'\n  tag \"fix_id\": 'F-73885r1_fix'\n  tag \"cci\": ['CCI-000172']\n  tag \"nist\": ['AU-12 c', 'Rev_4']\n  tag \"false_negatives\": nil\n  tag \"false_positives\": nil\n  tag \"documentable\": false\n  tag \"mitigations\": nil\n  tag \"severity_override_guidance\": false\n  tag \"potential_impacts\": nil\n  tag \"third_party_tools\": nil\n  tag \"mitigation_controls\": nil\n  tag \"responsibility\": nil\n  tag \"ia_controls\": nil\n  tag \"check\": \"If SQL Server Trace is in use for audit purposes, and SQL\n  Server Audit is not in use, this is not a finding.\n\n  The basic SQL Server Audit configuration provided in the supplemental file\n  Audit.sql uses the broad, server-level audit action group\n  SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP for this purpose.
