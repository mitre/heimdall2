#  List of the HTTP Origins for which to return Access-Control-Allow-* (CORS)
#   headers.
#  These headers tell browsers that web applications are trusted at those sites
#   to make requests to the REST interface.
#  The origin is passed as a URL without a path component (for example
#   "https://app.example.com:8000").
#  This setting can take a list of acceptable origins, separated
#   by spaces and/or commas.
#  Each origin can also contain wildcards for any part.  Examples:
#     *://app.example.com:*  (either HTTP or HTTPS on any port)
#     https://*.example.com  (any host under example.com, including
#     example.com itself)
#  An address can be prefixed with a '!' to negate the match, with
#   the first matching origin taking precedence.  For example,
#   "!*://evil.example.com:* *://*.example.com:*" to not avoid
#   matching one host in a domain
#  A single "*" can also be used to match all origins
#  No default.
