# Okta OpenID Connect PR Completion

## Current Status

You are working in the clean repository (`heimdall-clean`) where the Okta OpenID Connect implementation has been migrated. The migration involved copying essential implementation files and documentation from the original working repository, creating a clean branch `okta-openid-client-clean` with a single well-organized commit.

### Completed Work:
- ✅ Implemented Okta authentication strategy using openid-client
- ✅ Added PKCE for enhanced security
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Added appropriate session management
- ✅ Created detailed documentation
- ✅ Developed a testing plan with Zitadel OIDC server

### Current Branch:
- `okta-openid-client-clean` (clean branch with focused changes)

## Next Steps

1. **Adjust File Locations**
   - Move `.env.okta.example` from docs to the root directory
   - Ensure E2E test files are in the correct location (typically apps/backend/test/e2e)
   - Command: `mv docs/okta/.env.okta.example .env.okta.example`

2. **Verify Unit Tests**
   - Run tests to ensure everything still works after migration
   - Command: `cd apps/backend && npm run test src/authn`

3. **Complete E2E Testing Setup**
   - Set up the Zitadel OIDC server in Docker
   - Configure the test environment
   - Run E2E tests to validate the complete authentication flow

4. **Final PR Preparation**
   - Review all changes and documentation
   - Ensure PR description (from okta-pr-summary.md) is clear and complete
   - Push branch and create PR to master

## Key Files

### Implementation Files:
- `apps/backend/src/authn/okta.strategy.ts` - Core implementation 
- `apps/backend/src/authn/authn.controller.ts` - Controller with Okta routes
- `apps/backend/src/filters/authentication-exception.filter.ts` - Error handling
- `apps/backend/src/main.ts` - Session configuration

### Documentation:
- `docs/okta/okta-pr-summary.md` - PR description
- `docs/okta/okta-openid-client-documentation.md` - Implementation details
- `docs/okta/okta-testing-plan.md` - Testing strategy

### Testing:
- `docker-compose.okta.yml` - Docker setup for testing with Zitadel OIDC

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses the openid-client library for Okta authentication, replacing the previous passport-openidconnect implementation. Key features include:

- Automatic discovery of OpenID Connect endpoints
- PKCE for enhanced security (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- Email verification requirement
- Enhanced error handling with correlation IDs
- Proper session management and cookie settings

This implementation addresses the issue where the first login attempt would fail with state verification errors, providing a more reliable authentication flow.
