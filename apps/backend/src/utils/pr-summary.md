# Pull Request Summary: Authentication Logging Enhancements

## Overview

This PR enhances the logging system across all authentication strategies with structured logs, correlation IDs, and performance tracking. It also simplifies certificate management for development environments with automatic certificate detection.

## Key Features

### 1. Centralized Logger Utility
- Created a centralized logger utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`)
- Environment variable control (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FILE)
- Sanitization of sensitive data in logs
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- File output with rotation

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Logging
- Structured logging for all authentication strategies (OIDC, Okta, LDAP, GitHub, GitLab, Local, JWT)
- Consistent event naming pattern across strategies
- Authentication flow tracking with correlation IDs
- Performance monitoring with duration metrics
- Detailed initialization logs with configuration (secrets redacted)
- Enhanced error handling and reporting

### 3. Certificate Management Simplification
- Automatic detection and installation of certificates
- Simplified development environment setup
- Removed INSTALL_CUSTOM_CERTS flag from scripts
- Support for various corporate certificate locations

### 4. Improved Documentation
- Updated LOGGING.md with enhanced logging details
- Created comprehensive AUTHENTICATION.md with supported methods
- Added test guidance in logging-test-guide.md
- Updated README with auth documentation reference

### 5. Testing Improvements
- Created unit tests for core logging functionality
- Implemented practical tests for authentication strategy logging
- Simplified test approach focusing on value-added features
- Created comprehensive testing guide with best practices
- Demonstrated flexible approaches to test complex authentication strategies

## Implementation Details

### Logger Utility
The central logger utility provides a consistent interface for logging across the application with:
- Configurable log levels via environment variables
- Structured JSON logging format
- Automatic sanitization of sensitive information
- File output with rotation for production environments

### Authentication Strategies
All authentication strategies now use the centralized logger with:
- Standardized event naming (strategy_event_type)
- Configuration logging on initialization
- Performance tracking for authentication flows
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Consistent error reporting

### Certificate Management
The certificate management has been simplified by:
- Automatically detecting certificates in common locations
- Supporting the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable
- Making certificate installation seamless for development

## Testing Approach
Our testing approach focuses on:
- Testing core functionality like correlation ID generation
- Verifying logging patterns in authentication strategies
- Using simple mocks to avoid testing Winston internals
- Focusing on contracts between our code and logging
- Providing flexible test approaches for complex strategies
- Balancing test complexity with coverage and maintainability

## Changes to Run and Test

### Running with Enhanced Logging
```bash
# Run with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug yarn start:dev

# Run with file output
LOG_LEVEL=debug LOG_FILE=./logs/heimdall.log yarn start:dev
```

### Testing Logger Functionality
```bash
# Run core logger tests
yarn backend test:logger

# Run just the OIDC strategy logging tests
yarn backend test src/authn/oidc.strategy.spec.ts

# Run all logger and authentication tests
yarn backend test:logger:all

# Test with real output for manual verification
yarn backend test:logger:manual

# Test with debug level and file output
yarn backend test:logger:file
```

## Future Work

- Add API request logging with correlation IDs
- Implement comprehensive user session logging (logout events, session expiration)
- Create automated tests with Keycloak for authentication flows
