Configurations can only be \r\nchanged by a superuser.\r\n\r\n### Example: Change Auditing To Log Any ROLE Statements\r\n\r\nNote: This will override any setting already configured.\r\n\r\nAlter the configuration to do role-based logging:\r\n\r\n$ sudo su - postgres\r\n$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf\r\n\r\nAdd the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):\r\n\r\npgaudit.log = 'role'\r\n\r\nNow, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:\r\n\r\n$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}\r\n\r\n### Example: Set An Auditing Role And Grant Privileges\r\n\r\nAn audit role can be configured and granted privileges to specific tables and columns that need logging.\r\n\r\n##### Create Test Table\r\n\r\n$ sudo su - postgres\r\n$ psql -c \\\"CREATE TABLE public.stig_audit_example(id INT, name TEXT, password TEXT);\\\"\r\n\r\n##### Define Auditing Role\r\n\r\nAs PostgreSQL superuser (such as postgres), add the following to postgresql.conf or any included configuration files.\r\n\r\n$ sudo su - postgres\r\n$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf\r\n\r\nAdd the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):\r\n\r\npgaudit.role = 'auditor'\r\n\r\nNow, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:\r\n\r\n$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?} \r\n\r\nNext in PostgreSQL create a new role:\r\n\r\npostgres=# CREATE ROLE auditor;\r\npostgres=# GRANT select(password) ON public.stig_audit_example TO auditor;\r\n\r\nNote: This role is created with NOLOGIN privileges by default.\r\n\r\nNow any SELECT on the column password will be logged:\r\n\r\n$ sudo su - postgres\r\n$ psql -c \\\"SELECT password FROM public.stig_audit_example;\\\"\r\n$ cat ${PGDATA?}/${PGLOG?}/<latest_log>\r\n< 2016-01-28 16:46:09.038 UTC bob postgres: >LOG: AUDIT: OBJECT,6,1,READ,SELECT,TABLE,public.stig_audit_example,\r\nSELECT password FROM stig_audit_example;,<none>\r\n\r\n## Change Configurations During A Specific Timeframe\r\n\r\nDeploy PostgreSQL that allows audit configuration changes to take effect within the timeframe required by the \r\napplication owner and without involving actions or events that the application owner rules unacceptable.\r\n\r\nCrontab can be used to do this.\r\n\r\nFor a specific audit role:\r\n\r\n# Grant specific audit privileges to an auditing role at 5 PM every day of the week, month, year at the 0 minute mark.\r\n0 5 * * * postgres /usr/bin/psql -c \\\"GRANT select(password) ON public.stig_audit_example TO auditor;\\\"\r\n# Revoke specific audit privileges to an auditing role at 5 PM every day of the week, month, year at the 0 minute mark.\r\n0 17 * * * postgres /usr/bin/psql -c \\\"REVOKE select(password) ON public.stig_audit_example FROM auditor;\\\"\"\r\n\timpact 0.5\r\n\ttag severity: 'medium'\r\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-APP-000516-DB-000363'\r\n  tag gid: 'V-233600'\r\n  tag rid: 'SV-233600r617339_rule'\r\n  tag stig_id: 'CD12-00-010000'\r\n  tag fix_id: 'F-36759r617338_fix'\r\n  tag cci: [\"CCI-001914\"]\r\n  tag nist: [\"AU-12 (3)\"]\r\n\r\n\tsql = postgres_session(input('pg_dba'), input('pg_dba_password'), input('pg_host'), input('pg_port'))\r\n\r\n\tdescribe sql.query('SHOW shared_preload_libraries;', [input('pg_db')]) do\r\n\t  its('output') { should include 'pgaudit' }\r\n\tend\r\n  end\r\n",

Non-privileged users are individuals \r\nthat do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or \r\n\tmalicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from \r\n\tnon-privileged users.\r\n\r\nA privileged function in PostgreSQL/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, \r\nits built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and \r\nall security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: \r\n\r\nCREATE\r\nALTER\r\nDROP\r\nGRANT\r\nREVOKE\r\n\r\nThere may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as \r\nprivileged. Possible examples include:\r\n\r\nTRUNCATE TABLE;\r\nDELETE, or\r\nDELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or\r\nDELETE without a WHERE clause;\r\n\r\nUPDATE or\r\nUPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or\r\nUPDATE without a WHERE clause;\r\n\r\nany SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security \r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\nDepending on the capabilities of PostgreSQL and the design of the database and associated applications, the \r\nprevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database \r\ntriggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.\r\n\r\nHowever, the use of procedural languages within PostgreSQL, such as pl/R and pl/Python, introduce security risk. \r\nAny user on the PostgreSQL who is granted access to pl/R or pl/Python is able to run UDFs to escalate privileges \r\nand perform unintended functions.

It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming \r\n\tlanguages, including dialects of SQL. In such cases, the attacker deduces the manner in which SQL statements are \r\n\tbeing processed, either from inside knowledge or by observing system behavior in response to invalid inputs. When \r\n\tthe attacker identifies scenarios where SQL queries are being assembled by application code (which may be within \r\n\t\tthe database or separate from it) and executed dynamically, the attacker is then able to craft input strings \r\n\t\tthat subvert the intent of the query. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, \r\n\t\tincluding security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\r\n\r\nThe principal protection against code injection is not to use dynamic execution except where it provides necessary \r\nfunctionality that cannot be utilized otherwise. Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as \r\ninput parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\r\n\r\nWhen dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented \r\nboth in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:\r\n-- Allow strings as input only when necessary. \r\n-- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values \r\nfor them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.\r\n-- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\r\n-- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will \r\nnever be valid as input, reject them.\r\n-- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \r\n-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\r\n-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage \r\nsign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\r\n-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, \r\nMODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that \r\n\tsome of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. \r\n-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\r\n-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the \r\ndeveloper.\r\n-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\r\n-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\r\n-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a \r\nweb service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. \r\nNot only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.\"\r\n\tdesc\t'rationale', ''\r\n\tdesc\t'check', \"Review PostgreSQL source code (trigger procedures, functions) and application source code to \r\n\tidentify cases of dynamic code execution.\r\n\r\nIf dynamic code execution is employed without protective measures against code injection, this is a finding.\"\r\n\tdesc\t'fix', \"Where dynamic code execution is used, modify the code to implement protections against code \r\n\tinjection (IE: prepared statements).\"\r\n\timpact 0.5\r\n\ttag severity: 'medium'\r\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-APP-000251-DB-000392'\r\n  tag gid: 'V-233528'\r\n  tag rid: 'SV-233528r617333_rule'\r\n  tag stig_id: 'CD12-00-002000'\r\n  tag fix_id: 'F-36687r606808_fix'\r\n  tag cci: [\"CCI-001310\"]\r\n  tag nist: [\"SI-10\"]\r\n\r\n\tdescribe \"Review PostgreSQL source code and application source code to identify cases of dynamic code execution\" do\r\n\t\tskip \"If dynamic code execution is deployed without protective measures against code injection, this is a finding.\"\r\n\t  end\r\n\tend\r\n",

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been \r\n\tissued certificates by #{input('org_name')[:acronym]}-approved PKIs, all #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} systems, including databases, must be properly configured to \r\n\timplement access control policies.\r\n\r\nSuccessful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. \r\nAuthorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated \r\nand current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is \r\npermitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to \r\nimplement this requirement.\r\n\r\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access \r\nenforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and \r\nmechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of \r\n\tusers) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\r\n\r\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database \r\nmanagement systems. If PostgreSQL does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with \r\nnetworks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied \r\naccess inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.\"\r\n\tdesc\t'rationale', ''\r\n\tdesc\t'check', \"Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable.
