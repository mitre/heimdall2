Some operating systems may provide a capability that runs counter to the mission or\nprovides users with functionality that exceeds mission requirements. This includes\nfunctions and services installed at the operating system-level.\n\nSome of the programs,\ninstalled by default, may be harmful or may not be necessary to support essential\norganizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Removal of executable\nprograms is not always possible; therefore, establishing a method of preventing program\nexecution is critical to maintaining a secure system baseline.\n\nMethods for complying with\nthis requirement include restricting execution of programs in certain environments, while\npreventing execution in other environments; or limiting execution of certain program\nfunctionality based on organization-defined criteria (e.g., privileges, subnets,\nsandboxed environments, or roles).\n\n \"\n  desc 'check', \"Verify the operating system prevents program execution in accordance with local policies.\n\n\nCheck that AppArmor is installed and active by running the following command,\n\n$ dpkg -l |\ngrep apparmor\n\nIf the \\\"apparmor\\\" package is not installed, this is a finding.\n\n$ systemctl\nis-active apparmor.service\n\nactive\n\nIf \\\"active\\\" is not returned, this is a finding.\n\n$\nsystemctl is-enabled apparmor.service\n\nenabled\n\nIf \\\"enabled\\\" is not returned, this is a\nfinding. \"\n  desc 'fix', \"Install \\\"AppArmor\\\" (if it is not installed) with the following command:\n\n$ sudo apt-get\ninstall apparmor\n\n$ sudo systemctl enable apparmor.service\n\nStart \\\"apparmor\\\" with the\nfollowing command:\n\n$ sudo systemctl start apparmor.service\n\nNote: AppArmor must have\nproperly configured profiles for applications and home directories.
