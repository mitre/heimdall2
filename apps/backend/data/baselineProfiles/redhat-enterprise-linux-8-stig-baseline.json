Support for both internet and\nUNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and remote\nlogging.  Couple this utility with \\\"rsyslog-gnutls\\\" (which is a secure\ncommunications library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you\nhave a method to securely encrypt and off-load auditing.\n\n    Rsyslog provides three ways to forward message: the traditional UDP\ntransport, which is extremely lossy but standard; the plain TCP based\ntransport, which loses messages only during certain situations but is widely\navailable; and the RELP transport, which does not lose messages but is\ncurrently available only as part of the rsyslogd 3.15.0 and above.\n    Examples of each configuration:\n    UDP *.* @remotesystemname\n    TCP *.* @@remotesystemname\n    RELP *.* :omrelp:remotesystemname:2514\n    Note that a port number was given as there is no standard port for RELP.\n  \"\n  desc  'rationale', ''\n  desc  'check', \"\n    Verify the operating system has the packages required for encrypting\noffloaded audit logs installed with the following commands:\n\n    $ sudo yum list installed rsyslog-gnutls\n\n    rsyslog-gnutls.x86_64          8.1911.0-3.el8          @AppStream\n\n    If the \\\"rsyslog-gnutls\\\" package is not installed, ask the administrator\nto indicate how audit logs are being encrypted during offloading and what\npackages are installed to support it.  If there is no evidence of audit logs\nbeing encrypted during offloading, this is a finding.\n  \"\n  desc  'fix', \"\n    Configure the operating system to encrypt offloaded audit logs by\ninstalling the required packages with the following command:\n\n    $ sudo yum install rsyslog-gnutls\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag severity: 'medium'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227'\n  tag gid: 'V-230478'\n  tag rid: 'SV-230478r744011_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'RHEL-08-030680'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-33122r744010_fix'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-000366']\n  tag nist: ['CM-6 b']\n\n  if virtualization.system.eql?('docker')\n    impact 0.0\n    describe \"Control not applicable within a container\" do\n      skip \"Control not applicable within a container\"\n    end\n  else\n    describe package('rsyslog-gnutls') do\n      it { should be_installed }\n    end\n  end\nend\n",
