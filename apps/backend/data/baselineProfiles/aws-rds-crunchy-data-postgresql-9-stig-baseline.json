Unlimited concurrent connections\n  to PostgreSQL could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by\n  exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by\n  an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per\n  user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\n  This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account.\n  It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system\n  accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all\n  accounts.\n\n  The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be\n  configured in or added to PostgreSQL (for example, by use of a logon trigger),\n  when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit\n  sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users\n  and adversaries can potentially connect to PostgreSQL by other means.\n\n  The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent\n  sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on\n  the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of\n  the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for\n  general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too\n  few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where\n  each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\n  (Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the\n  purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)\n  \"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag \"severity\": \"medium\"\n  tag \"gtitle\": \"SRG-APP-000001-DB-000031\"\n  tag \"gid\": \"V-72863\"\n  tag \"rid\": \"SV-87515r2_rule\"\n  tag \"stig_id\": \"PGS9-00-001200\"\n  tag \"fix_id\": \"F-79305r2_fix\"\n  tag \"cci\": [\"CCI-000054\"]\n  tag \"nist\": [\"AC-10\", \"Rev_4\"]\n  tag \"false_negatives\": nil\n  tag \"false_positives\": nil\n  tag \"documentable\": false\n  tag \"mitigations\": nil\n  tag \"severity_override_guidance\": false\n  tag \"potential_impacts\": nil\n  tag \"third_party_tools\": nil\n  tag \"mitigation_controls\": nil\n  tag \"responsibility\": nil\n  tag \"ia_controls\": nil\n  desc \"check\", \"To check the total amount of connections allowed by the database,\n  as the database administrator, run the following SQL:\n\n  $ sudo su - postgres\n  $ psql -c \\\"SHOW max_connections\\\"\n\n  If the total amount of connections is greater than documented by an\n  organization, this is a finding.\n\n  To check the amount of connections allowed for each role, as the database\n  administrator, run the following SQL:\n\n  $ sudo su - postgres\n  $ psql -c \\\"SELECT rolname, rolconnlimit from pg_authid\\\"\n\n  If any roles have more connections configured than documented, this is a\n  finding.

Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all\n  information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific\n  data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).\n\n  The decision whether and what to encrypt rests with the data owner and is\n  also influenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and\n  media on which the information resides.\"\n\n  impact 0.5\n  tag \"severity\": \"medium\"\n  tag \"gtitle\": \"SRG-APP-000428-DB-000386\"\n  tag \"gid\": \"V-73003\"\n  tag \"rid\": \"SV-87655r1_rule\"\n  tag \"stig_id\": \"PGS9-00-008700\"\n  tag \"fix_id\": \"F-79449r1_fix\"\n  tag \"cci\": [\"CCI-002475\"]\n  tag \"nist\": [\"SC-28 (1)\", \"Rev_4\"]\n  tag \"false_negatives\": nil\n  tag \"false_positives\": nil\n  tag \"documentable\": false\n  tag \"mitigations\": nil\n  tag \"severity_override_guidance\": false\n  tag \"potential_impacts\": nil\n  tag \"third_party_tools\": nil\n  tag \"mitigation_controls\": nil\n  tag \"responsibility\": nil\n  tag \"ia_controls\": nil\n  desc \"check\", \"Review the system documentation to determine whether the\n  organization has defined the information at rest that is to be protected from\n  modification, which must include, at a minimum, PII and classified information.\n  If no information is identified as requiring such protection, this is not a\n  finding.\n\n  Review the configuration of PostgreSQL, operating system/file system, and\n  additional software as relevant.\n\n  If any of the information defined as requiring cryptographic protection from\n  modification is not encrypted in a manner that provides the required level of\n  protection, this is a finding.\n\n  One possible way to encrypt data within PostgreSQL is to use pgcrypto extension.\n\n  To check if pgcrypto is installed on PostgreSQL, as a database administrator\n  (shown here as \\\"postgres\\\"), run the following command:\n\n  $ sudo su - postgres\n  $ psql -c \\\"SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions where name='pgcrypto'\\\"\n\n  If data in the database requires encryption and pgcrypto is not available, this\n  is a finding.\n\n  If disk or filesystem requires encryption, ask the system owner, DBA, and SA to\n  demonstrate filesystem or disk level encryption.\n\n  If this is required and is not found, this is a finding.\"\n  \n  desc \"fix\", \"Configure PostgreSQL, operating system/file system, and additional\n  software as relevant, to provide the required level of cryptographic protection.\n\n  The pgcrypto module provides cryptographic functions for PostgreSQL.
