The following is an example configuration: \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_CRITICAL \nremark our control plane adjacencies are critical \npermit ospf host [OSPF neighbor A] any \npermit ospf host [OSPF neighbor B] any \npermit pim host [PIM neighbor A] any \npermit pim host [PIM neighbor B] any \npermit pim host [RP addr] any \npermit igmp any 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255 \npermit tcp host [BGP neighbor] eq bgp host [local BGP addr] \npermit tcp host [BGP neighbor] host [local BGP addr] eq bgp \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_IMPORTANT \npermit tcp host [TACACS server] eq tacacs any \npermit tcp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any eq 22 \npermit udp host [SNMP manager] any eq snmp \npermit udp host [NTP server] eq ntp any \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_NORMAL \nremark we will want to rate limit ICMP traffic \npermit icmp any any echo \npermit icmp any any echo-reply \npermit icmp any any time-exceeded \npermit icmp any any unreachable \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \nremark other management plane traffic that should not be received \npermit udp any any eq ntp \npermit udp any any eq snmp\npermit tcp any any eq 22 \npermit tcp any any eq 23 \nremark other control plane traffic not configured on router \npermit eigrp any any \npermit udp any any eq rip \ndeny ip any any \n\nip access-list extended CoPP_DEFAULT \npermit ip any any \n\nNote: Explicitly defining undesirable traffic with ACL entries enables the network operator to collect statistics. Excessive ARP packets can potentially monopolize Route Processor resources, starving other important processes. Currently, ARP is the only Layer 2 protocol that can be specifically classified using the match protocol command. \n\nStep 3: Review the policy-map to determine if the traffic is being policed appropriately for each classification. The following is an example configuration: \n\npolicy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \nclass CoPP_CRITICAL \npolice 512000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit \nclass CoPP_IMPORTANT \npolice 256000 4000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_NORMAL \npolice 128000 2000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_UNDESIRABLE \npolice 8000 1000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop \nclass CoPP_DEFAULT\npolice 64000 1000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop \n\nStep 4: Verify that the CoPP policy is enabled. The following is an example configuration: \n\ncontrol-plane \nservice-policy input CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY \n\nNote: Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to filter as well as police control plane traffic destined to the RP. CPPr is very similar to CoPP and has the ability to filter and police traffic using finer granularity by dividing the aggregate control plane into three separate categories: (1) host, (2) transit, and (3) CEF-exception. Hence, a separate policy-map could be configured for each traffic category.\n\nIf the Cisco router is not configured to protect against known types of DoS attacks by employing organization-defined security safeguards, this is a finding.","fix":"Configure the Cisco router to protect against known types of DoS attacks on the route processor.

Initiated by an attacker or a misconfigured router, prefix de-aggregation occurs when the announcement of a large prefix is fragmented into a collection of smaller prefix announcements.\n\nIn 1997, misconfigured routers in the Florida Internet Exchange network (AS7007) de-aggregated every prefix in their routing table and started advertising the first /24 block of each of these prefixes as their own. Faced with this additional burden, the internal routers became overloaded and crashed repeatedly. This caused prefixes advertised by these routers to disappear from routing tables and reappear when the routers came back online. As the routers came back after crashing, they were flooded with the routing table information by their neighbors. The flood of information would again overwhelm the routers and cause them to crash. This process of route flapping served to destabilize not only the surrounding network but also the entire Internet. Routers trying to reach those addresses would choose the smaller, more specific /24 blocks first. This caused backbone networks throughout North America and Europe to crash.\n\nMaximum prefix limits on peer connections combined with aggressive prefix-size filtering of customers' reachability advertisements will effectively mitigate the de-aggregation risk. BGP maximum prefix must be used on all eBGP routers to limit the number of prefixes that it should receive from a particular neighbor, whether customer or peering AS.

Volumetric attacks have become relatively easy to launch using readily available tools such as Low Orbit Ion Cannon or botnets. \n\nMeasures to mitigate the effects of a successful volumetric attack must be taken to ensure that sufficient capacity is available for mission-critical traffic. Managing capacity may include, for example, establishing selected network usage priorities or quotas and enforcing them using rate limiting, Quality of Service (QoS), or other resource reservation control methods. These measures may also mitigate the effects of sudden decreases in network capacity that are the result of accidental or intentional physical damage to telecommunications facilities (such as cable cuts or weather-related outages).","check":"Review the router configuration to determine if it is configured to enforce a QoS policy to limit the effects of packet flooding DoS attacks.\n\nStep 1: Verify that a class map has been configured for the Scavenger class as shown in the example below.\n\nclass-map match-all SCAVENGER\n match ip dscp cs1\n\nStep 2: Verify that the policy map includes the SCAVENGER class with low priority as shown in the following example below. \n\npolicy-map QOS_POLICY\n class CONTROL_PLANE\n    priority percent 10\n class C2_VOICE\n    priority percent 10\n class VOICE\n    priority percent 15\n class VIDEO\n    bandwidth percent 25\n class PREFERRED_DATA\n    bandwidth percent 25\nclass SCAVENGER\n    bandwidth percent 5\n class class-default\n    bandwidth percent 10\n\nNote: Traffic out of profile must be marked at the customer access layer or CE egress edge.\n\nIf the router is not configured to enforce a QoS policy to limit the effects of packet flooding DoS attacks, this is a finding.","fix":"Step 1: Configure a class map for the SCAVENGER class.\n\nR5(config)#class-map match-all SCAVENGER\nR5(config-cmap)#match ip dscp cs1\n\nStep 2: Add the SCAVENGER class to the policy map as shown in the example below:\n\nR5(config)#policy-map QOS_POLICY\nR5(config-pmap-c)#no class class-default\nR5(config-pmap)#class SCAVENGER\nR5(config-pmap-c)#bandwidth percent 5\nR5(config-pmap-c)#class class-default\nR5(config-pmap-c)#bandwidth percent 10\nR5(config-pmap-c)#end"},"impact":0.5,"refs":[{"ref":"DPMS Target Cisco IOS XE Router RTR"}],"tags":{"check_id":"C-17949r288090_chk","severity":"medium","gid":"V-216716","rid":"SV-216716r531086_rule","stig_id":"CISC-RT-000780","gtitle":"SRG-NET-000193-RTR-000112","fix_id":"F-17947r288091_fix","documentable":null,"legacy":["SV-106143","V-97005"],"cci":["CCI-001095"],"nist":["SC-5 (2)"]}},{"id":"SV-216717","code":"control 'SV-216717' do\n  title 'The Cisco multicast router must be configured to disable Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) on all interfaces that are not required to support multicast routing.'\n  desc %q(If multicast traffic is forwarded beyond the intended boundary, it is possible that it can be intercepted by unauthorized or unintended personnel.
