Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object\n  or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who\n  will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes\n  user-controlled table permissions.\n  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not\n  constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for\n  which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been\n  granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the\n  subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or\n  objects.\n  A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control\n  policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this\n  requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints\n  preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at\n  a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass\n  the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.\n  The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information\n  is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means\n  may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older,\n  more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require i\n  dentity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of\n  discretionary access control.","severity":"medium","gid":"V-72883","group_title":"SRG-APP-000328-DB-000301","rule_id":"SV-87535r1_rule","rule_ver":"PGS9-00-002200","cci_ref":["CCI-002165"],"nist":"AC-3 (4) Rev_4","check_content":"Review system documentation to identify the required\n  discretionary access control (DAC).\n  Review the security configuration of the database and PostgreSQL.
