Nevertheless,\n  protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases\n  that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain\n  assurances from the development organization that this issue has been\n  addressed, and must document what has been discovered.","gid":"V-81927","group_title":"SRG-APP-000178-DB-000083","rule_id":"SV-96641r1_rule","rule_ver":"MD3X-00-000800","cci_ref":["CCI-000206"],"nist":"IA-6 Rev_4","check_content":"For the
