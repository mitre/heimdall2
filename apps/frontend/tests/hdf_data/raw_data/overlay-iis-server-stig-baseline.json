Encryption of private information is\n  essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not\n  encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. A\n  private web server must use a FIPS 140-2-approved TLS version, and all\n  non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled.\n\n      FIPS 140-2-approved TLS versions include TLS V1.1 or greater.
