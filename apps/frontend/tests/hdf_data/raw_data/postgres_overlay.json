This results in unanticipated application behavior,\n  potentially leading to an application or information system compromise.\n  Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to\n  compromise an application.\n  With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as\n  SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the\n  dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including\n  dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to\n  data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.\n  Even when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in\n  the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and\n  usability of the system. Available protections include data types, referential\n  constraints, uniqueness constraints, range checking, and application-specific\n  logic. Application-specific logic can be implemented within the database in\n  stored procedures and triggers, where appropriate.\n  This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require\n  collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many\n  cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the\n  application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code.\n  Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure\n  operation of databases that they must not be ignored.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object\n  or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who\n  will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes\n  user-controlled table permissions.\n  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not\n  constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for\n  which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been\n  granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the\n  subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or\n  objects.\n  A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control\n  policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this\n  requirement.

In cases where PostgreSQL-stored private keys are used to\nauthenticate PostgreSQL to the system’s clients, loss of the corresponding private\nkeys would allow an attacker to successfully perform undetected man-in-the-middle\nattacks against PostgreSQL system and its clients.\n\nBoth the holder of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful\nmeasures to protect the corresponding private key. Private keys should always be\ngenerated and protected in FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules.\n\nAll access to the private key(s) of PostgreSQL must be restricted to authorized and\nauthenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to one or more of\nPostgreSQL's private keys, an attacker could gain access to the key(s) and use them\nto impersonate the database on the network or otherwise perform unauthorized\nactions.\"\n  impact 0.7\n  tag \"severity\": \"high\"\n  tag \"gtitle\": \"SRG-APP-000176-DB-000068\"\n  tag \"gid\": \"V-73029\"\n  tag \"rid\": \"SV-87681r1_rule\"\n  tag \"stig_id\": \"PGS9-00-010200\"\n  tag \"cci\": [\"CCI-000186\"]\n  tag \"nist\": [\"IA-5 (2) (b)\", \"Rev_4\"]\n  tag \"check\": \"First, as the database administrator (shown here as \\\"postgres\\\"),\nverify the following settings:\n\nNote: If no specific directory given before the name, the files are stored in\nPGDATA.\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW ssl_ca_file\\\"\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW ssl_cert_file\\\"\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW ssl_crl_file\\\"\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW ssl_key_file\\\"\n\nIf the directory these files are stored in is not protected, this is a finding.\"\n  tag \"fix\": \"Store all PostgreSQL PKI private keys in a FIPS 140-2 validated\ncryptographic module.

Without establishing what type of event occurred, it would be difficult to\nestablish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify\nthose responsible for one.\n\nAudit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this policy\nincludes, for example, time stamps, user/process identifiers, event descriptions,\nsuccess/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control\nrules invoked.\n\nAssociating event types with detected events in the application and audit logs\nprovides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization or\ncapacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured application.\n\nDatabase software is capable of a range of actions on data stored within the\ndatabase. It is important, for accurate forensic analysis, to know exactly what\nactions were performed. This requires specific information regarding the event type\nan audit record is referring to. If event type information is not recorded and\nstored with the audit record, the record itself is of very limited use.\"\n  impact 0.5\n  tag \"severity\": \"medium\"\n  tag \"gtitle\": \"SRG-APP-000095-DB-000039\"\n  tag \"gid\": \"V-73033\"\n  tag \"rid\": \"SV-87685r1_rule\"\n  tag \"stig_id\": \"PGS9-00-010400\"\n  tag \"cci\": [\"CCI-000130\"]\n  tag \"nist\": [\"AU-3\", \"Rev_4\"]\n  tag \"check\": \"As the database administrator (shown here as \\\"postgres\\\"), verify\nthe current log_line_prefix setting in postgresql.conf:\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW log_line_prefix\\\"\n\nVerify that the current settings are appropriate for the organization.\n\nThe following is what is possible for logged information:\n\n# %a = application name\n# %u = user name\n# %d = database name\n# %r = remote host and port\n# %h = remote host\n# %p = process ID\n# %t = timestamp without milliseconds\n# %m = timestamp with milliseconds\n# %i = command tag\n# %e = SQL state\n# %c = session ID\n# %l = session line number\n# %s = session start timestamp\n# %v = virtual transaction ID\n# %x = transaction ID (0 if none)\n# %q = stop here in non-session\n# processes\n\nIf the audit record does not log events required by the organization, this is a\nfinding.\n\nNext, verify the current settings of log_connections and log_disconnections by\nrunning the following SQL:\n\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW log_connections\\\"\n$ psql -c \\\"SHOW log_disconnections\\\"\n\nIf both settings are off, this is a finding.\"\n  tag \"fix\": \"Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA environment variable.\nSee supplementary content APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA.\n\nTo ensure that logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for\ninstructions on enabling logging.\n\nIf logging is enabled the following configurations must be made to log connections,\ndate/time, username and session identifier.\n\nFirst, edit the postgresql.conf file as a privileged user:\n\n$ sudo su - postgres\n$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf\n\nEdit the following parameters based on the organization's needs (minimum\nrequirements are as follows):\n\nlog_connections = on\nlog_disconnections = on\nlog_line_prefix = '< %m %u %d %c: >'\n\nNow, as the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:\n\n# SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY\n$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-9.5\n\n# INITD SERVER ONLY\n$ sudo service postgresql-9.5 reload\"\n\n  sql = postgres_session(PG_DBA, PG_DBA_PASSWORD, PG_HOST)\n\n  log_line_prefix_escapes = %w(%m %u %d %s)\n  log_line_prefix_escapes.each do |escape|\n    describe sql.query('SHOW log_line_prefix;', [PG_DB]) do\n      its('output') { should include escape }\n    end\n  end\n\n  describe sql.query('SHOW log_connections;', [PG_DB]) do\n    its('output') { should_not match /off|false/i }\n  end\n\n  describe sql.query('SHOW log_disconnections;', [PG_DB]) do\n    its('output') { should_not match /off|false/i }\n  end\nend\n","source_location":{"line":42,"ref":"/home/ec2-user/.inspec/cache/96e6b8877a3a240490c08879e504472ff3102500/controls/V-73033.rb"},"results":[{"status":"failed","code_desc":"PostgreSQL query with errors: SHOW log_line_prefix;
