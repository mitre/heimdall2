information in transmission.\"\n  desc  \"Without the association of security labels to information, there is no\nbasis for the DBMS to make security-related access-control decisions.\n\n    Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or\ncharacteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to\nsafeguarding information.\n\n    These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g.,\ntables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of\naccess control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination,\nhandling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the\ninformation security policy.\n\n    One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security\nlabels may be assigned manually or during data processing, but, either way, it\nis imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If\nthe security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a\ndata compromise.\n\n    SQL Server does not include security labeling as a standard or licensable\nfeature. Earlier releases of this STIG suggested using the SQL Server Label\nSecurity Toolkit, from codeplex.com.  However, codeplex.com has been shut down,\nand it is unclear whether the Toolkit is still supported.  If the organization\ndoes have access to the Toolkit, it may still be used, provided the\norganization accepts responsibility for its support.  Other implementations may\nalso exist.

labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or\ncharacteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to\nsafeguarding information.\n\n    These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g.,\ntables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of\naccess control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination,\nhandling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the\ninformation security policy.\n\n    One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security\nlabels may be assigned manually or during data processing, but, either way, it\nis imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If\nthe security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a\ndata compromise.\n\n    SQL Server does not include security labeling as a standard or licensable\nfeature. Earlier releases of this STIG suggested using the SQL Server Label\nSecurity Toolkit, from codeplex.com.  However, codeplex.com has been shut down,\nand it is unclear whether the Toolkit is still supported.  If the organization\ndoes have access to the Toolkit, it may still be used, provided the\norganization accepts responsibility for its support.  Other implementations may\nalso exist.
