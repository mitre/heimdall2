## RECOVERY PROMPT

You are working on the Heimdall2 project with four main areas of focus:

1. Authentication Logging Enhancements (Primary PR)
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs across 7 auth strategies
   - Standardized test patterns and 50+ tests for auth components
   - Documentation in utils/README.md and enhancement-progress.md

2. Certificate Management Enhancements
   - Added test script (certs/test-certs.sh) to validate certificates
   - Created validation plan (certificate-validation-plan.md)
   - Enhanced documentation with conversion guides
   - Integrated certificate validation into Docker development

3. Development Environment Standardization
   - Created Docker-based development environment using UBI9
   - Resolved package conflicts in Docker build process
   - Added certificate management to Docker environment
   - Organized data persistence with ./data directory
   - Refactored heimdall-development.sh script into modular components
   - Implemented container name variables for flexibility
   - Created environment-aware image naming (heimdall-app:${NODE_ENV})
   - Added comprehensive environment template system
   - Enhanced database authentication for container networking
   - Improved startup script with better user feedback

4. Test Infrastructure Issue
   - Identified conflict with mock-fs in parallel test execution
   - Documented in test-infrastructure-issue.md
   - Need to decide if this should be part of current PR

Your most recent work focused on enhancing the Docker development environment with:
1. A modular script architecture (splitting heimdall-development.sh into logical components)
2. Container name variables for flexibility (DB_CONTAINER_NAME, APP_CONTAINER_NAME, PROXY_CONTAINER_NAME)
3. Environment-aware image naming (heimdall-app:${NODE_ENV})
4. Comprehensive environment template system for .env files
5. Database authentication improvements for container networking
6. Enhanced startup script with better user feedback and progress indicators

Next steps include testing the database connection with the updated authentication settings, verifying the complete development environment workflow, updating documentation for the modular architecture and container naming convention, and finalizing the PR for authentication logging enhancements.

## CLI Testing Completion (April 6, 2025)

We have successfully completed a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the CLI package, converting from Mocha to Jest and implementing a consistent testing strategy across all commands.

### Current Status

1. **Unit Test Implementation Complete**:
   - All CLI commands now have comprehensive unit tests
   - Successfully mocking services at appropriate boundaries
   - Testing behavior rather than implementation details
   - Full test coverage for all command options and flags

2. **Test Structure Improvements**:
   - Commands organized by category (cert, env, db, build, setup)
   - Consistent testing pattern across all command tests
   - Proper mocking at service boundaries
   - Clear test cases for success and error scenarios

3. **Test Statistics**:
   - 166 passing tests in 19 test suites
   - No failing tests
   - Excellent coverage of command functionality

4. **Key Achievements**:
   - Successfully refactored commands to be testable via dependency injection
   - Created a standardized testing pattern applied consistently
   - Created a testing matrix documenting what to test and what to mock
   - Improved code quality through test-driven development principles

### Next Phase: Integration Testing

Our next phase of testing will focus on integration tests that verify how the CLI interacts with actual dependencies:

1. **CLI-Docker Integration Tests**:
   - Test actual Docker container operations
   - Verify container status checks with real containers
   - Test build and start operations with controlled test containers

2. **CLI-Database Integration Tests**:
   - Test actual database operations in a test environment
   - Verify backup/restore with real files and database instances
   - Test database reset operations with actual data

3. **CLI-Certificate Integration Tests**:
   - Test certificate generation with real file output
   - Verify certificate installation in test containers
   - Test certificate validation with actual certificate files

4. **Integration Test Infrastructure**:
   - Create a controlled test environment for integration tests
   - Implement clean-up mechanisms for test artifacts
   - Develop helper utilities for integration test setup and teardown

The integration tests will use a semi-controlled environment where:

1. Real Docker commands will be executed, but against test-specific containers
2. Real filesystem operations will occur, but in a dedicated test directory
3. Real database operations will be performed, but against a test database instance

The test environment will be set up before each integration test and torn down after to ensure test isolation and repeatability.

### Integration Test Implementation Plan

We'll create a dedicated integration test directory structure:
```
/test
  /integration
    /helpers        # Shared test utilities
    /docker         # Docker integration tests
    /database       # Database integration tests
    /certificate    # Certificate integration tests
    /setup          # Setup integration tests
    /fixtures       # Test data and fixtures
```

Our approach will follow these principles:
1. Use real dependencies but in a controlled, isolated test environment
2. Clean up all test artifacts after tests complete
3. Ensure tests can run independently and in any order
4. Use actual CLI commands but with special test-only flags
5. Verify outcomes by checking actual system state

#### Technical Details of Integration Test Setup

1. **Test Helper Modules**:
   - `test-environment.ts`: Set up and tear down test environment
   - `docker-helper.ts`: Docker-specific test utilities
   - `database-helper.ts`: Database-specific test utilities
   - `certificate-helper.ts`: Certificate generation/verification utilities
   - `test-logger.ts`: Special logger for integration tests

2. **Test Environment Configuration**:
   - Use unique identifiers for all test resources
   - Create isolated test directories for file operations
   - Use test-specific container names to avoid collisions
   - Set environmental variables to control test behavior

3. **Isolation Strategy**:
   - All tests will run in an isolated directory with prefix: `heimdall-test-{timestamp}-{random}`
   - Docker containers use test-specific names: `heimdall-test-db-{timestamp}-{random}`
   - All test artifacts get cleaned up via afterAll handlers
   - Integration tests have special environment flags to indicate test mode

4. **Execution Strategy**:
   - Jest's `setupFilesAfterEnv` will prepare global test environment
   - Each test category has its own setup/teardown specific to that domain
   - Test ordering ensures dependent tests run in correct sequence
   - Timeouts are extended for real-world operations

This integration testing will complement our unit tests and provide end-to-end validation of the CLI's functionality. The first integration tests we plan to implement are for the Docker integration, focusing on container operations and verification.
