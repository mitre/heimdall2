# Heimdall2 Combined Enhancement PR Status

This document consolidates the status of the combined authentication logging and CLI enhancement PR. It serves as a unified tracking document to simplify progress monitoring.

## PR Overview

This PR has two main components:
1. **Authentication Logging Enhancements**: Adding correlation IDs, performance tracking, and improved error handling
2. **CLI Implementation**: Replacing shell scripts with a modern, maintainable CLI for development environment management

## Authentication Logging Status: ~95% Complete

### Completed Items
- ✅ Implemented centralized logger utility with correlation IDs
- ✅ Enhanced all authentication strategies with structured logging
- ✅ Added performance tracking metrics to authentication flows
- ✅ Improved error handling and categorization
- ✅ Added security-focused logging (client IP, failure categorization)
- ✅ Fixed state verification and cookie handling issues
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for all authentication strategies
- ✅ Added documentation for the logging system

### Remaining Items
- 🔄 Remove any debug/console logs in the code
- 🔄 Final review of all logging messages for consistency

## CLI Implementation Status: ~90% Complete

### Completed Items
- ✅ Core environment commands (status, start, stop, logs)
- ✅ Database commands (backup, restore, list, reset)
- ✅ Certificate commands (status, generate, download, install)
- ✅ Build commands (build, rebuild, refresh, reset, clean)
- ✅ Added support for targeted builds (all, dev, nginx, db)
- ✅ Added `--auto-start` flag to build commands
- ✅ Completed basic CLI integration test infrastructure

### Remaining Items
- 🔄 Complete CLI command help text
- 🔄 Finalize documentation for each CLI command
- 🔄 Final side-by-side testing with shell scripts

## Testing Status

### Completed Tests
- ✅ All authentication strategy tests pass
- ✅ Authentication exception filter tests pass
- ✅ Logger utility tests pass
- ✅ Basic CLI command tests pass

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ NODE_DEBUG setting in Docker causing excessive logging
- ⚠️ Possible file path issue with new FileSystem interface for configuration
